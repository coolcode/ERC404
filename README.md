- **What it is**: A Foundry template for rapidly initializing an ERC404 project.
- **ERC404**: Developed by the Pandora team, ERC-404 is a new unofficial token standard that aims to bridge the divide between fungible tokens and NFTs.**
- **How it works**: ERC-404 creatively mixes elements from the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards, which are traditionally not designed to interact. Its ERC-721 approach deviates from the norm by relying on token mints and burns for fractional transfers.
- **Pandora**: A collection of 10,000 Replicants enabled by ERC404, an experimental token standard.
